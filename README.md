# Unpackerr

Unpackerr is an application that runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD and in Docker. You can use it to _watch_ a download folder and extract new items. However the more common use is to watch starr apps (radarr, sonarr, readarr, lidarr, whisparr) and extract items they download. It can do both, at the same time even. 

The app supports sending webhooks and running scripts before and after archive decompression. Useful if you want [notifications](https://notifiarr.com).

Other tools, like [xt](https://github.com/Unpackerr/xt) compliment Unpackerr by giving you a handy command line application to simply extract a bunch of stuff in one go.

We hope you find these tools useful on your endeavour to collect more software!
